## DEV-1545 : Beyond Domino Designer

### Abstract

The contemporary web developer uses a plethora of tools beyond Domino Designer. The session will showcase how to leverage AngularJS, Webpack and Jasmine to supercharge web and mobile development (a.k.a application modernization) for Domino applications.
