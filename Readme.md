## DEV-1545 : Beyond Domino Designer

### Abstract

The contemporary web developer uses a plethora of tools beyond Domino Designer. The session will showcase how to leverage AngularJS, Webpack or Grunt to supercharge web and mobile development (a.k.a application modernization) for Domino applications. Domino's NoSQL and declarative security paired with the new JavaScript tools will let you design applications that are 'not your daddy's Notes anymore.' Besides showcasing the tooling, the session will highlight a productive developer workflow for Notes developers.
